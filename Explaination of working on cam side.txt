Hardware messages of ArducamMegaSPI Camera Module

1. Introduction
This application note describes the detail hardware messages of ArducamMegaSPI Camera Module.

2. SPI Slave Interface
Arducam Mega SPI slave interface is fixed SPI mode 0 with POL=0andPHA=0. 
The recommended speed of SCLK is 8MHz. 
Also note that the performance may vary across different platforms. 
The SPI protocol is designed with a command phase with variable data phase. 
The chip select signal shouldalwayskeep asserted during the SPI read 

explaned:

SPI Mode:

Fixed at mode 0: This means the clock signal (SCLK) is low when the data is latched on the rising edge and changes state on the falling edge.

POL=0: The polarity of the clock signal is active-low, meaning the data is valid when the clock is low.

PHA=0: The phase of the clock signal is leading, meaning the data changes on the same edge of the clock as the latching edge.

. SCLK Speed:
Recommended speed of 8MHz: This is the optimal speed for reliable communication with the Arducam Mega. However, the actual performance may vary depending on your platform and setup.

SPI Protocol:
Command Phase: The initial phase where you send a command to the Arducam Mega, specifying the action you want it to perform (e.g., read data, write data).
Variable Data Phase: The length of the data phase depends on the specific command and the amount of data being transferred.

Chip Select:
This signal must be held low (asserted) throughout the entire SPI bus cycle, both for reading and writing data. This tells the Arducam Mega that it is being addressed and should be active.

In simpler terms:

Imagine the Arducam Mega as a device you want to talk to.
SPI is the language you use to communicate with it.
Mode 0, POL=0, and PHA=0 are like the rules of grammar and pronunciation in that language.
The SCLK speed is like the speaking pace, 8MHz being the recommended default.
The SPI protocol has two parts: telling the Arducam Mega what to do (command) and actually doing it (data transfer).
The chip select signal is like a handshake, letting the Arducam Mega know you're talking to it.

3. ArducamMega TimingDiagram

3.1 Single Read Timing
The SPI bus single read timing is for read operation of ArducamMegainternalregisters and single FIFO read function. 
It is composed of a commandphaseandadata phase during the assertion of chip select signal CSn. 
The first 8bits isthecommand byte which is decoded as a register address. 
The second 8bits isthedummy data, which is used to provide a delay area in a very short timetopreparedata for the camera.
The final 8 bits is written to the SPI bus MOSI signal, andthecontent read back from register is appeared on the SPI bus MISOsignal.

explained:
Imagine you're communicating with the Arducam Mega camera like talking to a friend. 
To get information from the camera, you use a special language called SPI. 
Here's how single read timing works in this language:

1. Getting ready:

You raise your hand like saying "Hey!" 
This is the chip select signal (CSn) going high, telling the camera you're talking to it.

2. Asking a question:

You say the first 8 words out loud.
These are the command byte, similar to asking a question "Tell me about...?" 
The 8 words translate to a specific register address within the camera, like a room number in a library where the answer lives.

3. Taking a short break:

You mumble a few words quickly (about 8 of them), like giving the camera a moment to gather the answer. 
This is the dummy data and creates a tiny delay for the camera to prepare the information.

4. Listening for the answer:

You raise one hand and wait. This is like preparing to hear the answer.
 Now, the camera sends back 8 words on the SPI bus MISO signal, like someone answering your question. 
These words hold the data stored in the register you asked about.

5. Wrapping up:

You lower your hand (CSn going low) to say "Thank you!" and end the conversation.

Things to remember:

This process happens during the command phase and data phase while the chip select is raised.
The dummy data allows for slight variations in communication speed between different devices.
This is just for single reads, other SPI functions might have different timing.

3.2 Single Write Timing

The SPI bus write timing composed of a command phase and a data phaseduringthe assertion of the chip select signal CSn. 
The first 8 bits is commandbytewhichis decoded as a register address, and the second 8 bits is data byte tobewrittentothe Arducam Mega internal registers.

explained:

1. Get attention:

Raise your hand (CSn high) to grab the camera's attention. 
This tells it you're initiating a conversation.

2. Give instructions:

Speak the first 8 words (command byte). These words act like a command, similar to saying "Change this setting to..." 
The 8 words translate to a specific register address, like the room in the library where you want to put new information.

3. Tell what to set:

Say the next 8 words (data byte). 
These words are like the actual message you want to convey, similar to saying "Make it equal to..." 
The 8 words contain the data you want to write to the specified register, like updating the number on a shelf in the library.

4. Send confirmation:

Lower your hand (CSn low) to signal "All done!" This tells the camera you've finished sending the instructions.

Key points:

This happens during the command phase and data phase while CSn is high.
The command byte specifies the register to write to, while the data byte determines the actual value to be written.
This is for writing operations, the timing for reading might be different.

3.3 First Time Burst Read Timing

SPI bus burst read timing only applies to burst FIFO read operations.
 It consistsofa burst read command phase and multiple data phases to achieve multipletimesthroughput compared to a single FIFO read operation. 
Similar to a single read mode, when formally burst reading data, the first byte is the dummydata(Allowenough time for data preparation) and the subsequent data is valid.

explained:

Start by getting attention: Raise your hand like saying "Hey!" 
This is the chip select signal (CSn) going high, signaling the camera you're ready to talk.

Give the command: Instead of asking for one book, you give a special instruction, the burst read command. 
This tells the camera to prepare a whole batch of books, like giving a librarian a genre or theme.

Receive the first package: Similar to grabbing the first book from the pile, the camera sends a dummy byte. 
This gives it a moment to gather the rest of the batch you requested.

Enjoy the reading feast: Now comes the exciting part! Multiple sets of 8 words (data phases) follow the dummy byte, each containing one of the books you wanted. 
You can think of these phases as the librarian bringing out stacks of books related to your request.

Say thank you and leave: 
Finally, you lower your hand (CSn goes low) to signal you're done reading.

Important points to remember:

This is only for burst FIFO read operations, not regular single reads.
Compared to single reads, it's like getting ten books instead of one, achieving much faster throughput.
The first byte is like skipping past the first page to get to the good stuff, giving the camera time to prepare the rest.

3.4 Nth Burst Read Timing(N>=2)
Different from the First Time burst read mode, when the Nth burst readcommandis issued, the data will start to be prepared directly, and all subsequent datareceived will be valid data.

Demystifying Nth Burst Read Timing in Arducam Mega:
Imagine you're back at the library, thrilled by the efficiency of burst reading. 
But now, you need more books from the batch you requested earlier. 
Here's how the Nth burst read comes in:

Demystifying Nth Burst Read Timing in Arducam Mega:
Imagine you're back at the library, thrilled by the efficiency of burst reading. But now, you need more books from the batch you requested earlier. Here's how the Nth burst read comes in:

First burst read:
You asked for a bunch of books on a specific theme (burst read command).
The librarian preps some books, sends a dummy one while gathering the rest (first byte is dummy).
You receive all the actual books one by one (valid data in subsequent bytes).

Nth burst read (where N > 1):

You want more books from the same theme (another burst read command).
This time, the librarian skips the prep work because they already have the batch ready.
You immediately receive all the remaining books one by one (no dummy byte, all valid data).

Key differences:

First burst read requires a dummy byte for initial preparation.
Nth burst read utilizes the existing prepared batch, so no dummy byte is needed.
Both offer faster data transfer compared to single reads.

In simple terms:

Imagine the camera pre-filling a basket with your requested books after the first burst read command.
Subsequent commands just grab from that basket, no waiting needed.
